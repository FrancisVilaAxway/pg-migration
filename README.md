# pg-migration
A nodejs package to help with database migrations -- that is, changes to your database over time.

# Status
This is a new project and not ready for consumption. 

# Contributions
Status aside, of course contributions are welcomed but please know that I'm transposing a group of modules I wrote for another project. I'm restructuring it as an open source library as opposed to an in-app component.
