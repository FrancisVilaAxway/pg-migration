# pg-migration
A nodejs package to help with database migrations -- that is, changes to your 
database over time.

## Status
This project is close to being ready for consuming. Being that I need it for 
something else, I expect it'll be ready in a couple of days.  
 
## Examples
Examples are fourth coming. At this point in time, the best examples are 
contained within the unit tests.

## Contributions
Status aside, of course contributions are welcomed but please know that 
I'm transposing a group of modules I wrote for another project. I'm 
restructuring it as an open source library as opposed to an in-app 
component.

I am open to simple architectural suggestions as Node.js/JavaScript isn't 
my "main" programming language. That said, I'm trying to take queues from 
Nightwatch and pg-promise and am -- at a high level -- following those 
ideas amongst my own..
